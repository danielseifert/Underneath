    Towering monoliths decked in armor of the most glorious fay forging,
    the Knights of Iridescence live only to serve and protect those weaker than
    themselves. Their weaponry, armor, and very flesh are infused with Heavenly
    energies, their minds and souls upheld by Honor, as well as the desire to
    visit the Wrath of Heaven upon the darkness that seeps up from below.

    Bound in solemn covenant of Flesh and Material to the Perfect Absence, those who
    bear the name of Zero are feared the world over. Trained to perfection in the
    arts of stealth and speed, and with the power of Null woven into their very cells,
    Zeroes may be seen as slight and fragile, but there are none so well-versed in
    the arts of reducing life to a Null Value.

    To the mind of a Magus, the laws of space, time, matter, and energy are mere opinions:
    ones they happen to profoundly disagree with. They carry with them secrets that can
    shatter, warp, and even remake reality around them, but such secrets come at a profound
    cost, as their very essence teeters on the border between madness and godhood. The
    mind of a Magus is a wispy thing, stretched to the breaking point in a desperate
    gamble to contain powers that the 'realistic' would think uncontainable. But then
    again, who cares about 'realism' when reality is soft as butter around you?

    Proud, strong, and nigh unstoppable, the Soldiers of Iridescence were
    once normal humans, but now, thanks to the sciences of flesh, energy, and
    metal, they stand in the way of all that seek to darken the realm of light.
    Wielding gun, blade, and their technology-born powers, they may appear to 
    be but men, but they are more, oh, so much more.
